### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational biologist ðŸŒ± in molecular dynamics of condensed phase organic compounds, mainly proteins. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in a startup company called Fermify GmbH for the production of cheese protein via fermentation in Vienna, Austria.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the fields of Intrinsically Disorder Proteins (IDPs) and Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) using molecular dynamics (MD).
